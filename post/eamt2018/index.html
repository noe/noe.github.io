<p>I recently attended the
<a href="http://www.eamt.org/" target="_blank">European Association for Machine Translation</a>.
conference, <a href="http://eamt2018.dlsi.ua.es/" target="_blank">EAMT 2018</a>.
Before this conference I had only attended <a href="/post/iclr2018/">ICLR</a>, which is
an AI conference focused on representation learning, irrespective of the specific
task or paradigm (RL, GANs, NLP, images, etc). On the other hand EAMT is purely
machine translation-focused.</p>

<p>This year EAMT took place over three days. The first day was focused on research (mostly academia),
the second day on products and projects (industry) and the third one on translators
(translators track).</p>

<p>One of the recurring topics was <strong>translation quality evaluation</strong> techniques.
Despite BLEU being the dominant automatic measure and that to some degree it is correlated
with human judgement, it is clear that the machine translation
community is longing for a more grounded quality evaluation measure.
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bhaddow/" target="_blank">Barry Haddow</a> gave a talk about the
<a href="http://www.statmt.org/wmt18/" target="_blank">WMT competition</a>, and commented on how, apart
from automatic measures, they use human-driven evaluation. They
previously used human-driven relative ranking but now they resort to
direct assessment (human evaluator assigns a mark between 0 and 100 with
their judgement about the degree in which the translation adequately expresses
the meaning of the reference translation, without ever seeing the source
sentence).</p>

<p>A piece of research that had already caught my attention and that was presented
at EAMT was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06189" target="_blank">Investigating Backtranslation in Neural Machine Translation</a>.
It explores the use of <strong>back-translation</strong> as a means to improve translation
performance. Back-translation consists in: you want to train a language
direction <em>a ➝ b</em> and you don&rsquo;t have much parallel data but you have a lot
of monolingual data in the target language <em>b</em>, so what you do is
training an auxiliary translation system on the <em>b ➝ a</em> direction, and you create a synthetic
parallel corpus by using your auxiliary system on your monolingual data.
You now add your synthetic data to the original parallel data you had an
<em>voilà</em>, you can train your <em>a ➝ b</em> system on a lot of real + synthetic parallel data.
This is a practice that most groups and companies seem to be applying nowadays, as
evidenced by the
<a href="http://matrix.statmt.org/?mode=all" target="_blank">WMT 2018 news translation task system brief descriptions</a>.</p>

<p>My company, <a href="http://www.lucysoftware.com/" target="_blank">Lucy Software</a>,
has been devising <strong>Rule-based Machine Translation (RBMT)</strong> systems for over 30 years.
To my delight, at EAMT I got the confirmation that RBMT
systems are still relevant nowadays, especially for low-resource
<a href="https://www.quora.com/When-is-a-language-said-to-be-morphologically-rich" target="_blank">morphologically-rich</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language" target="_blank">agglutinative</a> languages with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_order" target="_blank">flexible word order</a>, like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language" target="_blank">Basque</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language" target="_blank">Turkish</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_language" target="_blank">Kazakh</a>.
My main line of research at Lucy consists in hybridizing RBMT and
NMT to leverage the large amount of formalized linguistic knowledge in our
rule-based systems in the form of monolingual and bilingual lexicons and grammars
for source language analysis, source to target transfer and target language generation.
Confirming that the linguistic knowledge in rule-based
systems is crucial for some language pairs encourages me to pursue my RBMT-NMT
hybrid and to test it on such type of languages.</p>

<p>As a side note, be aware that using BLEU to assess the performance of an
RBMT system in comparison with SMT or NMT is unfair. This
quality evaluation measure compares <em>ngram-wise</em> the translation against a
reference human translation, normally taken
from a holdout set from a larger training corpus. The translations by SMT and NMT systems
are expected to be similar to the reference. RBMT translations are not necessarily so
similar to the references. Therefore, comparing RBMT against SMT and NMT on the basis
of BLEU scores is not a sensible practice. Reviewers
of the world, please take this into account when you ask article authors for BLEU scores.</p>

<p>In the last years, the work of many human translators has shifted from pure translation
to <strong>post-edition of machine translations</strong> due to the the increasing
quality in machine translations. However, post-edition work is much less
<em>rewarding</em> to them, and it is paid less.
It is no secret that those human translators are
worried about how MT may affect their work in the future,
and even fearing that its quality may reach the point where there is
no space for human translators anymore.
With the newly introduced <em>translators track</em>, this year EAMT
conference gave the machine translation community the opportunity to
interact with human translators to get direct insight on how they
feel about that and to try to find better synergic workflows
involving MT and human translators. One of the conclusions of the
translators was specially interesting: as NMT translations are very very
fluent, post-editors need to pay more attention (i.e. devote more time) than with
SMT not to overlook problems in the translated sentence.</p>
